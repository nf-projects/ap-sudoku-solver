**Describes the overall purpose of the program**
a

**Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in
the video**
a

**Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in
the video**
a

**The first program code segment must show how data have been
stored in the list.**
a

**The second program code segment must show the data in the
same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing
data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling
the program’s purpose.**
a

**Identifies the name of the list being used in this response**
a

**Describes what the data contained in the list represent in your
program**
a

**Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program
code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or
how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list**
a

**The first program code segment must be a student-developed
procedure that:
□ Defines the procedure’s name and return type (if necessary)
□ Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect
on the functionality of the procedure
□ Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection,
and iteration**
a

**The second program code segment must show where your
student-developed procedure is being called in your program.**
a

**Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it
contributes to the overall functionality of the program**
a

**Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the
identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed
enough for someone else to recreate it.**
a

**Describes two calls to the procedure identified in written response
3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a
different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.
First call:**
a

**Second call:**
a

**Describes what condition(s) is being tested by each call to the
procedure
Condition(s) tested by the first call:**
a

**Condition(s) tested by the second call:**
a

**Identifies the result of each call
Result of the first call:**
a

**Result of the second call:**
a
